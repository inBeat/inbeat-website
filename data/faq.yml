      answer: >-
        It provides you a good overview of an Instagram influencer's audience engagement. In other words, do people react to

    - question: How Can I Use The Information In My Influencer Marketing?
      answer: >-
        It's always a tricky question to answer, but here is how we do it. We use the engagement rate as a gauge of trust for
        the influencers we work with throughout our influencer marketing campaigns. It isn't the only thing you should analyze.
        Instagram influencers can purchase fake comments and likes, which can make this metric obsolete. Although there are
        tools out there to calculate the number of fake followers, a judgment call will always outperform these tools. Ask
        yourself questions such as: are there comments shallow or off-topic? Do they have a low number of comments?
    - question: What type of content gets the better engagement on Instagram?
      answer: >-
        The best-performing content for influencers tends to be authentic content and compelling content. 
        The posts must have 5-10 relevant hashtags. Video content and Instagram reels are also good ways to boost engagement rates.
    - question: What is a good engagement rate on Instagram?
      answer: >-
        Between 1 and 3% is considered an average engagement rate. 
        The higher the engagement rate goes from here, the more audience quality the influencer (or creator) has. Audience age is also a factor, as younger generations tend to be more active and willing to comment on Instagram. 
        Follower count is also a big factor, the more followers you have, the more difficult it gets to engage them.
    - question: How can you use engagement rate for your influencer marketing?
      answer: >-
        The more engaged users an influencer gets, the most willing to interact with the post the audience is. 
        It is a good metric to identify an active audience that is more likely to be responsive to your campaign. 
        Engagement rate is one of the top factors for DTC brands when forecasting influencer marketing ROI.
    - question: Why should I care about the Instagram engagement rate for influencer marketing?
      answer: >- 
        Far too often, companies doing influencer marketing only focus on vanity metrics when evaluating influencers (followers, likes, impressions). 
        Vanity metrics matter but they don't tell the whole story. If the target audience is engaged towards the influencer you are collaborating with (either posts or Instagram stories) your company will have more chance of building a successful campaign.

        They already have passion for your market which now aligns with your brand.
        <br><br>

fake_follower_checker:
  - question: How Do You Calculate an Instagram Account's Audience Score?
    answer: >-
      inBeat's Fake Followers Checker online tool uses the average engagement rate, average likes and average comments. We then cross analyze this data with target data from industry standards and evaluate the audience quality. We do not examine the influencer's followers individually in this calculation. We have found that cross-referencing average VS target data is rather accurate.
      The higher the audience score, the better the social engagement.
  - question: What Are Fake Followers?
    answer: >-
      Fake followers are social media profiles only meant to boost a profile's follower count without actual value.  They bring fake likes and generic comments but no authentic engagement. They are also referred to as bot accounts or spam profiles.
      When an influencer has a lot of fake followers, they have low follower credibility, as their social profiles are based on inauthentic activity.
  - question: Why Use inBeat's Fake Followers Checker?
    answer: >-
      Our free marketing online tool helps you connect to genuine influencers with relevant audiences made of human followers with real accounts. inBeat's Fake Followers checker saves you a lot of resources by scanning social profiles for you and detecting which potential influencers are followed by fake accounts.
  - question: Isn't it better to collaborate with influencers with a bigger follower count to reach more potential customers?
    answer: >-
      Fair question. You may think that a bigger audience is a better bang for your buck, but don't be fooled: it's easy to buy fake accounts and generic comments or create fake profiles to bump one's social following and charge more for influencer partnerships.
      Celebrity influencers with a huge audience of thousands of followers aren't necessarily a good choice for your social media marketing campaigns. As follower growth goes up, audience quality usually goes down. This is why we prefer to work with micro-influencers, as they are a better way to reach your target demographics through active followers and a relevant audience.
  - question: How can you use credibility rate for your influencer marketing?
    answer: >-
      By evaluating audience quality, you can better choose authentic influencers followed by legitimate accounts; engaging with your target audience is what brings revenue!
      Our Fake Followers Checker allows you to connect to genuine influencers: real people with real followers and engagement authenticity.
  - question: Why should I care about the Instagram audience score for influencer marketing?
    answer: >-
      A big follower count means nothing if it consists of fake profiles, inactive accounts and ghost followers. Don't waste your time and money on fake influencers who charge big bucks without an engaged audience. Our audit tool brings social proof to your social media marketing.
  - question: How to Spot Fake Followers on Instagram?
    answer: >-
      There are many ways you can tell if someone has fake followers. The straightforward approach is to go and check each suspect's fake follower profile. Most of the bots acting as fake followers have very few posts and/or activity on their page. Also, many bots don't have a profile picture on their account or are using a photo taken on Google image. Using Google image reverse search will reveal a potential red flag.
  - question: How can you tell if someone has fake followers?
    answer: >-
      The best way to find out if someone has bought their audience and has fake followers is to use a fake follower audit tool such as ours. It's a great way to find out instantly the follower quality score of an influencer's audience. This credibility score gives you a good idea of whether the account is followed by real persons or bots.

      ROI.<br>
      Let’s say an influencer’s post costs $100. Using personalized promo codes or affiliate links, you
      tracked that the people who read that post bought $500 worth of products from your website. In
      this case, your ROI is (500/100) x 100 = 500%.<br>
  - question: What are the most common KPIs in influencer marketing?

ctr_calculator:
  - question: What Does CTR Mean?
    answer: >-
      CTR means Click Through Rate; it is an indication of how engaging an ad is. The CTR<br>
      measures the ratio of people clicking on an ad when exposed to it.
  - question: What is the CTR formula?
    answer: >-
      The formula to measure the click-through rate is pretty simple; it goes as follows:<br>
      <b>Total Clicks / Total Impressions</b><br>
      For example, if you have an ad that generated 6 clicks for 100 impressions, your CTR is
      6/100=0,06 (or 6%).
  - question: Why is CTR important?
    answer: >-
      Analyzing the click-through rate is important.<br>
      When comparing ads running under the same target audience, the CTR gives a good indication
      of the ads that are performing better, more engaging, or catching the audience's attention more
      than the other.
      When comparing the same ad running under two different audience targeting, it indicates which
      audience group is more engaged when exposed to the ad.
      Using CTR is a good starting point when optimizing your social media advertising campaigns.
      Higher CTR usually means a higher conversion rate. It's one of the key metrics to analyze for a
      successful marketing strategy.
  - question: What affects your CTR?
    answer: >-
      <b>Many factors can affect CTR performances. Amongst those many factors, we can identify:<br></b>
      &#x25CF; Targeting: some audiences will be more reactive than others when they see your ad.
              identifying the right persona is very important.<br>
      &#x25CF; Copywriting: test different variations to ensure your ad copy is engaging and has the right call to action.<br>
      &#x25CF; Creative: whether it's an image or video, your creative is probably the most important factor in ensuring your ad catches your audience's attention and converts.<br>
      &#x25CF; Offer: A "too good to miss" offer will drastically improve your CTR.<br>
  - question: What is a good click-through rate?
    answer: >-
        There is no universally good, bad, or average click-through rate. It will depend on the kind of
        platform you are advertising on.<br> Google Search Ads tend to have higher CTR than other social
        media;<br> for example, this is because search ads capture intent and are distributed to people
        actively searching for your product or niche.<br>
  - question: How to increase the click-through rate?
    answer: >-
      <b>Improving the click-through rate can be achieved with multiple levers:<br></b>
      &#x25CF; Testing and optimizing audience targeting.<br>
      &#x25CF; Writing more engaging ad copy.<br>
      &#x25CF; Promoting compelling offers<br>
      &#x25CF; Creating engaging visuals and content<br> 
cpa_calculator:
  - question: What Does CPA Mean?
    answer: >-
      In marketing and advertising, CPA refers to the cost per acquisition. How much does it cost in
      ad spent to get a lead, a conversion, an app install, or any other conversion metric used in your
      KPI.
  - question: Why measuring CPA is important
    answer: >-
      Measuring your cost per acquisition is one of the ultimate metrics to determine if your paid
      media strategy or campaign is profitable or not. Make sure that you are determining a target
      CPA beforehand. The CPA is the pulse that helps you decide between doubling down or
      shutting down a campaign, ad group or creative.
  - question: How do you calculate a CPA
    answer: >-
        The cost per acquisition formula is very straightforward, it equals your total cost divided by your
        total conversion (or acquisition) :<br>
        <b>CPA = Total Cost / Total Acquisitions</b>
  - question: What is a good CPA
    answer: >-
        A good CPA depends on the service/product you promote. If you are advertising a free mobile
        app, your target CPA will be lower than if you are selling a car, for example. As a rule of thumb,
        you should target a CPA that would give you a ROAS (return on ad spend) higher than 2.
  - question: How to lower the CPA of your PPC campaign
    answer: >-
      <b>Many levers can help lower your cost per acquisition:<br></b>
      &#x25CF; Identify your target persona and target it in audience settings (A/B test different personas).<br>
      &#x25CF; Create engaging content and visuals in your ads (UGC content, for example).<br>
      &#x25CF; Make your offer and USP clear and appealing.<br>
      &#x25CF; Work on your ad copy to engage your audience.<br> 
      &#x25CF; Make the conversion process on your landing page easy.<br> 
bounce_rate_calculator:
  - question: What is the bounce rate?
    answer: >-
        The bounce rate refers to the percentage of a website's visitors that closes the website without
        performing a single action or visiting any other page. It often is assimilated to traffic quality or
        landing page quality. A high bounce rate usually means that your page doesn't answer what the
        user was looking for, is not loading fast enough, has errors, or that the traffic you send to the
        page (via ads or other) isn't quality traffic.
  - question: How to calculate bounce rate?
    answer: >-
          The bounce rate is calculated by dividing your single-page sessions by the total sessions on
          your website.<br>
          <b>Bounce Rate = Total of Single Page Sessions / Total of Sessions</b>
  - question: What's considered a healthy bounce rate?
    answer: >-
          A bounce rate is considered "good" when it is under 40 percent, "average" if it's between 41 and
          55 percent, and "mediocre" if it's between 56 and 70 percent. Any bounce rate above 70 percent
          indicates very low page quality or traffic quality and that your strategy must be revisited or your
          page edited.
  - question: How to improve my website's bounce rate?
    answer: >-
        <b>Many factors can help improve your page bounce rate, whether it comes from technical
        improvement or content improvement.<br></b>
        &#x25CF; Improve your site speed.<br>
        &#x25CF; Improve your website's mobile responsiveness<br>
        &#x25CF; Fix any bug your page has<br>
        &#x25CF; Capture attention early on your page<br> 
        &#x25CF; Answer your target audience request early on the page.<br> 
        &#x25CF; Use appealing calls to action and buttons to make visitors want to visit other pages.<br> 
  - question: What's the difference between bounce rate and exit rate?
    answer: >-
          Exit rate refers to the percentage of visitors that end their visit or a specific page. Bounce rate
          refers to visitors that exit your page without visiting any other page.

roas_calculator:
  - question: What is ROAS?
    answer: >-
        ROAS, or return on ad spend, is a metric that measures the efficiency of an advertising
        campaign. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue generated from the campaign by the total
        amount spent on advertising
  - question: What is the ROAS calculation formula?
    answer: >- 
          The ROAS formula is as follows:</br>
          ROAS = Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend</br>
          For example, if your advertising campaign generated $500 in revenue and you spent $100 on
          ad spend, your ROAS would be 500/100 = 5.</br>
          This means that you got 5 times in return compared to the investment you made. Needless to
          say, this is a good ROAS.
  - question: What is a good ROAS?
    answer: >-
          The ideal ROAS will vary significantly depending on your business and the goals of your
          advertising campaign. In general, a good ROAS is one that generates a positive return on
          investment (ROI), meaning that the revenue generated from the campaign is higher than the
          cost of the ad spend.</br>
          In short, any ROAS higher than the score of 1 should be considered good.
  - question: How do I use the ROAS Calculator?
    answer: >-
          To use the inBeat ROAS Calculator, you will need to input the following information:</br>
          &#x25CF; The total amount spent on your advertising campaign.<br>
          &#x25CF; The total revenue generated from the campaign<br>
          &#x25CF; Once you enter this information, the calculator automatically shows your ROAS and displays the result.<br>
  - question: What are some factors that can influence my ROAS metric?
    answer: >-
          There are many factors that can influence your ROAS metric. Some of them include:</br>
          &#x25CF; The target audience for your advertising campaign<br>
          &#x25CF; The type of ads you are using (e.g. display ads, search ads, etc.)<br>
          &#x25CF; The effectiveness of your ad copy and visuals<br>
          &#x25CF; The overall performance of your website or landing page<br>
          &#x25CF; The competitiveness of your industry<br>
          &#x25CF; The seasonality of your business<br>
          The short answer is - it depends.
  - question: How do I calculate my breakeven ROAS?
    answer: >-
          To calculate your break-even ROAS, you will need to know the total cost of your advertising
          campaign and the total profit generated from the campaign. Once you have this information, you
          can use the following formula to calculate your break-even ROAS:
          Break Even ROAS = Total Cost / Total Profit</br>
          For example, if your advertising campaign cost $5,000 and generates $10,000 in profit, your
          break-even ROAS would be 500/1000 = 0.5. This means that to break even on your advertising
          campaign, you need a ROAS of at least 0.5.
