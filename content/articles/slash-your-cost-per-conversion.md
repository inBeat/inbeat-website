It covers guidelines, selling points, and moodboards. Your creator needs to understand what you are seeking.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h4 id="definingyouridealclientasthestartingpoint">Defining your ideal client as the starting point</h4>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Before diving into any work, define your end customer. If you don’t have a persona built for your brand’s ideal client, make that now.</p><p>You must know who your client is. How old are they? Who do they follow on Instagram? Where do they live?</p><p>This part of the task is natural for e-commerce brands; you have the data and insider know-how to understand who your customer is.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The ideal brief covers aesthetics, format, and messaging. You want to provide your influencer with sales know-how while allowing them to express their creativity.</p><ol><li><strong>Aesthetics :</strong> Communicate your visual guidelines with the influencers. Include content from past collaborations that match your brand’s ethos. If you don’t have such content, create a mood board with content you appreciate from other brands on Instagram. Dig into their collaborations and find content you endorse. You can use Pinterest to organize this. <em>Find brands you like on Instagram and search their feed for collaborations.</em></li><li><strong>Format :</strong> Look at your Facebook ads, as well as your competitors’. You want to know which ad format drives results. Carousel, Stories, GIF, etc. <em>Add your format restrictions to the brief.</em></li><li><strong>Messaging :</strong> What is the goal of the content you are creating? Is there a specific Unique-Selling Proposition of your product you want to put forward? Give your influencers an overview of your product and the selling points you want to convey. Remember, you will use these visuals in your paid media - think of them in that context.</li></ol><h3 id="step-2-discover-relevant-influencers">Step 2: Discover relevant influencers</h3><p>After you have created your brief, you want to discover influencers. Use your client persona to take an educated guess at what influencers are relevant to your brand.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->{{% protip title="Author's note" %}}
I prefer contacting influencers by email than by DM, as the response rate is better. Email also makes it easier to use a CRM tool. Thus, I skip any influencer for which I can’t find an email.

I prefer working with micro-influencers (2000 to 10 000 followers on Instagram). The content quality is better, and the price is much lower.

However, if your product has a High Cost of Good Sold, such as a mountain bike, you will seek influencers with a larger audience to justify your upfront cost.

{{% /protip %}}<!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="long-term-strategies">Long-term Strategies</h2><p>You now have a working influencer content and distribution strategy. It is time to consider long-term implementations for your brand.</p><h3 id="hire-your-influencers">Hire Your Influencers</h3><p>Hiring your influencers to be long-term ambassadors is a great way to generate IGC regularly. These ambassadors will also build more trust for your brand, considering the ongoing access you get to their audiences.</p><p><strong>Make it fun for your creators to be part of your ambassador program.</strong></p><p>Pay a fixed sum each month, share exclusive offers, make them part of your product decisions, and give the brand swag they need to rock across their social media.
