<p>Influencer marketing is one of the most effective ways to tell your brand story to the right audiences. But, the world of influencers is hard to navigate alone. To maximize the ROI of your campaigns, you need to select <strong>the top 20 influencer marketing agencies 2021 </strong>that will set you up for success.</p><p>In this article, we will explain what an influencer marketing agency does and review the best agencies in 2020.</p><h3 id="what-does-an-influencer-marketing-agency-do">What Does an Influencer Marketing Agency Do?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Top-Influencer-marketing-agencies-2020-1-.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Top Influencer Marketing Agencies for 2021"></figure><p>Influencer marketing campaigns are complex and challenging to plan and execute. Successful campaigns have many variables. They include optimization, vetting, structuring, contract negotiations, content reviews. These variables are hard to manage without relevant experience and resources.</p><p>Influencer marketing agencies work together with brands to plan, execute, and manage influencer marketing campaigns. Top influencer marketing agencies have close relationships with the leading creators. They know <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/using-inbeat/">how to find the right influencers</a> for your brand with proven success and a history of quality performance. Agencies negotiate rates, contracts, review content, report on campaigns. They act as a central force in maximizing influencer collabs' ROI.</p><h3 id="how-to-choose-a-top-influencer-marketing-agency">How to Choose a Top Influencer Marketing Agency?</h3><p><strong>Research agency's past campaigns, what brands and influencers they worked with.</strong></p><p>Reviewing their clients' portfolio and track record will help you determine if the agency has the experience to run a successful campaign. Ask for relevant case studies and analyze the influencers an agency works with. Some agencies specialize in collaborations with celebrity influencers. As a result, they charge very high fees for their service. Smaller brands looking to reach highly targeted audiences should instead consider working with agencies with an extensive micro-influencers network. They have higher engagement than celebrity influencers and will keep your campaign spend low.</p><p>Understanding what type of campaigns and influencers the agency is comfortable with will allow you to evaluate the agency's capacity to deliver the best results for you.</p><p><strong>Understand their work process and how transparent they are about the strategies they deploy.</strong></p><p>Top influencer marketing agencies can explain in detail how they handle new campaigns, including their criteria to select influencers and platforms. Agency must clarify how they measure a campaign's success and which metrics they use to evaluate the ROI. Pay attention to tangible benefits, such as increased follower count, website traffic, leads, and conversions.</p><p><strong>Check the quality of tools to run and measure your influencer marketing campaigns</strong></p><p>Top influencer marketing agencies do not act only as middlemen between your brand and influencers. They offer sophisticated modern tools to communicate with influencers, process payments, access real-time campaign reports, and optimize performance. These tools allow you to measure the success of your influencer marketing campaigns against your KPIs. Avoid agencies that are unable to quantify and demonstrate specific campaign metrics.</p><h3 id="top-20-influencer-marketing-agencies-2021">Top 20 Influencer Marketing Agencies 2021</h3><p>To help you choose who to partner with, we've put together a list of top 20 influencer marketing agencies.

The outcome: it built over a thousand successful campaigns.</p><p>The Goat also understands that <strong>vanity metrics are less important than performance data</strong>.  So, an influencer's number of followers and engagement rate don't count as much as downloads, clicks, and conversion rates.
