But most of the micro-influencers (50%) we surveyed prefer it didn’t.</p><p>“Can’t say I’m in love with the neon trend. I’m more of a neutral kind of girl!” says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_emoliveira/">@_emoliveira</a>, who loves walks and nature.</p><p>A Toronto-based micro-influencer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickibats/">@nickibats </a>also names neon among the worst fashion trends of 2020 but admits to owning one neon green top.</p><p><strong>2. <strong><strong>Bermuda Shorts</strong></strong></strong></p><p>This summer Bermuda shorts trend was a hot topic among the fashion crowd. Although some love this 90s vibe, it is facing some resistance from the influencer community. Reasons? Bermuda shorts can be quite unflattering if worn incorrectly by drawing extra attention to the thighs.</p><p>New-York based influencer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allysonburgess/">@allysonburgess </a>who runs her fashion <a href="https://www.authenticallyallyson.com/">blog</a> loves bold and colorful style but calls Bermuda shorts “the worst fashion trend” of the season.</p><p>Bermuda shorts also did not make it to the list of the favorite fashion trends for the entertainment and fashion blogger <a href="https://www.instagram.com/christina_cord/">@christina_cord.</a></p><p><strong>3. <strong><strong>Platform Sandals</strong></strong></strong></p><p>Platform sandals were quite popular in the ‘00s and made a comeback in a range of styles this season. The platform that has been forgotten for a decade for single-sole shoes is gaining traction again.</p><p>But some micro-influencers wish for it to go back into hibernation and consider it the worst fashion trend of 2020.</p><p>Among them is  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_christineewong/">@_christineewong</a>, who shared that platform sandals are bulky and difficult to walk in.</p><p>Stylish <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachel.hersey/">@hersey.kiss</a>  says that she “can’t decide,” which she hates more “low rise jeans or platform sandals.”</p><p><strong>4. <strong><strong>Chunky Sneakers</strong></strong></strong></p><p>The trend for sneakers continues into 2020, morphing into a more aggressive form of the trainers - chunky sneakers. While some are fascinated by this radical style, most of the influencers we surveyed think that chunky sneakers were never cool.</p><p>“Can we leave the chunky sneakers, biker shorts, and lingerie tiny tops behind?” says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/inspiredbyj/">@inspiredbyj, </a>an NYC-based Instagram micro-influencer.</p><p>Another opponent of this style, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lindsrosso/">@lindrosso</a>, replied: “Chunky sneakers. I absolutely will never sport those!” when we asked her about the worst fashion trend of the year.</p><p><strong>5.  Lack of Individuality</strong></p><p>We need to keep up to date with the latest fashion trends and explore the creative side of ourselves. But do not let the trends dictate how you look. Project your true self to the world. Maintaining individuality and expressing yourself in your own way is more essential than following the hype.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/anniesitni/">@Anniesitni</a>, a Russian influencer based in NYC, highlights the importance of being unique by saying: “when people are following fashion trends blindly, personal style is getting lost.”</p><blockquote><strong>“when people are following fashion trends blindly, personal style is getting lost.”</strong></blockquote><p>According to @shelbypine, the worst fashion trend of the year is that “everyone is trying to look like each other and not staying true to themselves.”</p><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zoedgs/">@zoedgs</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shanilasays/">@shanilasays</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allthingscoveted/">@allthingscoveted</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fashionistareb/">@fashionistareb</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vic_carnevale/">@vic_carnevale</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ssmode__/"> @ssmode__</a> , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missstephteee/">@missstephteee</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michelleallegra/">@michelleallegra</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/katarinabrunette/">@katarinabrunette</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/layersofchic_/">@layersofchic_</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nycnichole/">@nycnichole</a>, for making this article happen!  </p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p>2. </p>
