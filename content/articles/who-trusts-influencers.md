<p>The team at inBeat, a tool to help you find the best influencers on TikTok and Instagram, decided to research the trust people have in influencers. It turns out that trust is unevenly distributed across age groups, which makes sense. We do believe, however, that the description of an influencer is different for the 45 to 54 age group. In other words if a boomer is looking at a Youtube video to help her or him choose their next BBQ for the summer, do they consider that person an influencer?</p><p>Needless to say that influencers have an impact on all age groups, even though their mental representation of the concept might vary.</p><p>In this infographic, we display visually the insight and data we have gathered throughout this research.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/pdfresizer.com-pdf-optimize-page-001.jpg" class="kg-image"></figure>
