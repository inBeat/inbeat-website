faq:
  questions:
    - answer: >-
        Yes, you can change or cancel your plan at any time in your settings.
        Once you have canceled your plan, you will retain access to your premium
        plan until the end of your subscription cycle. At this point, you will
        be moved to our free plan.
      question: Can I cancel my subscription whenever I want?
    - answer: >-
        We currently support most major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, and
        American Express).
      question: What forms of payment do you accept?
    - answer: >-
        This depends on the scale at which you want to do influencer marketing.
        Think about how many influencers you want to work with and how many you
        will need to contact. Each influencer with an email that is exported
        will cost 1 credit.
      question: How many credits do I need?
    - answer: >-
        Our platform is built around a usage model. For each influencer you
        export, you will be charged 1 credit. If the influencer does not have an
        email linked to it, you will not be charged. When exporting a list, you will receive the following information: Handle, Email, Profile URL, Language, Followers, Engagement, Topics, Website
      question: What counts as a contact export?
    - answer: >-
        We sure do! Contact us directly at support@inbeat.co and we will unlock
        our charity plan for you.
      question: 'We are a charity, do you have any special discounts?'
    - answer: >-
        Our system will warn you if you exceed your plan limit. You will be able
        to uprade your plan at this stage.
      question: Can I exceed my plan's credit?
