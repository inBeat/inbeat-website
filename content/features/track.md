faq:
  - question: How do you track my influencer marketing campaign?
    answer: >-
      inBeat Pulse tracks your influencer relationships through both hashtag (#) and user (@) mentions on both Instagram, and TikTok. Our influencer marketing software allows you to track your influencer marketing campaigns in real-time.
  - question: Do you offer real-time influencer tracking?
    answer: >-
      We offer tracking at a 60 minutes interval. Pulse will notify you when a new post is discovered. Our influencer marketing software has the ability to track posts and stories on Instagram, as well as video posts on TikTok.
  - question: Do you track both TikTok and Instagram?
    answer: >-
      Yes. We track both TikTok and Instagram. However, a campaign within our tool can only contain influencers from one social media platform. If you want to track influencers on both TikTok and Instagram, you would need to create two different campaigns.
  - question: Should I track my influencer marketing?
    answer: >-
      Tracking influencers is a good way to stay on top of things when running a campaign. A lot of influencers forget to post, and using Pulse is a good way to keep them in check. Influencer tracking (Pulse) also allows you to identify your most successful influencers at a glimpse.
